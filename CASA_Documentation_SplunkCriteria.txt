#### About CASA

| Author | Anonymous |
| --- | --- |
| App Version | 01 |
| Has index-time operations | true, this add-on must be placed on indexers (LOOK to see if indexer & SearchHead can be seperated) |
| Create an index | true, impacts disk storage |
| Implements summarization | true, data model, data model acceleration by default |

The CASA app allows a Splunk® Enterprise administrator to analyze CAs (Certificate Authorities), using simple visualizations to summarize the trusted CAs found across a network, as well as comparison capabilities against a whitelist/blacklist.

##### Scripts and binaries

Include a list of scripts and binaries that exist in the add-on and the purpose of each.
1) certificateCollection_v4 -  Performs the gathering of data on each SUF endpoint. 
2) Status.cmd -  Because restrictions prevent a .ps1 from being run directly this script will start the Batch script.

#### Download

Download the <appname> at <link to app location>.

#### Installation steps

Begin configuration by first setting up the deployment app with your deployment server and ensuring endpoints are collecting. In order for collection to begin, Splunk must have permissions to execute PowerShell commands.

Configuration Items:
  1) Setup Index
  2) Deployment App
  3) Endpoint Collection
  4) Frequency of Collection

  (1) Setup Index:
  By default, CASA uses an index called cert_auth. In order to use a different index, or add additional indexes, see below to modify the associated tag in the app.

  CASA references the index and source in each of the visualizations using the following tags: certificate_index and certificate_source. If you want to change the field/value pairs for these tags

  Change the Settings > Tags > List by tag name, be sure to sort by App 'CASA' and edit the certificate_index/certificate_source field-value pair to the new index/source.csv.
  Change the deployment-apps index stanza found under $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\casa_deployment_app\inputs.conf.

  (2) Deployment App:
  The CASA Splunk Deployment App found at this location [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\casa_deployment_app] should be moved to the deployment-apps directory on the Deployment Server [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\deployment-apps]

  The app should then be added, via the GUI, to the desired server class. If a deployment server is not used, the app should be unzipped and placed in the apps directory on the desired Universal Forwarders -

  [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps]

  (3) Endpoint Collection:
  The endpoints will perform collection according to when the job is configured to run.


  PowerShell:
  Splunk must have have permission to execute the Batch script PowerShell commands. WIthout this permission the SUF can not gather the CA information for CASA.

  Edit the code on the Splunk Deployment Server [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\deployment-apps\casa\bin\certificateCollection_v4.ps1] in order to add any X.509 extension fields.

  By default the script gathers the following fields:

  Primary Fields:

  PSParentPath
  Enhanced Key Usage List
  Issuer
  NotAfter
  NotBefore
  Serial Number
  Public Key Algorithm
  Public Key Size
  Encoded Key Parameters
  Signature Algorithm
  Thumbprint
  Version
  Subject
  Public Key Value

  Extended Fields (note, not all certificates use all extended fields):

  Unique Identifiers
  Authority Key Identifier
  Subject Key Identifier
  Key Usage
  Certificate Policies
  Policy Mappings
  Subject Alternate Name
  Issuer Alternate Name
  Subject Directory Attributes
  Basic Constraints
  Name Constraints
  Policy Constraints
  Extended Key Usage
  CRL Distribution Points
  Inhibit Policy
  Freshest CRL
  Authority Information Access
  Subject Information Access


  CertificateList.csv:
  Once the script has run a new file will be generated on that local host endpoint containing all of the fields and values collected: .\Windows\System32\certificateList.csv

  This is the resulting file which is read into splunk by the SUF.



  Altering the Lookup Tables:
  Within the $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\lookups folder, there exist three lookup table files: DefaultCAList.csv, Whitelist.csv, and Blacklist.csv. To alter any of these lists, open the file in a text editor and save the changes; the lookup tables will be automatically updated.


  (4) Frequency of Collection:
  The current configuration allows for collection of CAs once a week. To alter this collection two changes must be made.

  The first change is in the deployment app. Navigate to $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\deployment-apps\casa\local and open inputs.conf. Alter the cron schedule to the desired range, save the changes, and redeploy the app to the desired hosts (Note: the changes must be made on all of the hosts).
  The second change is in the searches within the CASA app. Navigate to $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\default and open savedsearches.conf. For every saved search, find the search key and alter the hoursago argument to the desired ranged. Preferably, this integer would correlate to the time lapse between ingest cycles. Restart Splunk. [default is 7 days or 168 hours ago]


##### Deploy to single server instance

Follow these steps to install the app in a single server instance of Splunk Enterprise:

**Install to search head**

1. Setup Index:
  - By default, CASA uses an index called cert_auth. In order to use a different index, or add additional indexes, see below to modify the associated tag in the app.

  - CASA references the index and source in each of the visualizations using the following tags: certificate_index and certificate_source. If you want to change the field/value pairs for these tags
    + Change the Settings/Manager > Tags, sort by App 'CASA' and edit the certificate_index field-value pair to the new index.
    + Change the deployment-apps index stanza found under $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\casa_deployment_app\casa\inputs.conf.

2. Deployment App:
  - The CASA Splunk Deployment App found at this location [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\casa_deployment_app\casa] should be moved to the deployment-apps directory on the Deployment Server [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\deployment-apps]

  - The app should then be added, via the GUI, to the desired server class. If a deployment server is not used, the app should be unzipped and placed in the apps directory on the desired Universal Forwarders [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps]. Restart splunkd to push application.


##### Deploy to distributed deployment

**Install to search head**

1. Setup Index:
  - By default, CASA uses an index called cert_auth. In order to use a different index, or add additional indexes, see below to modify the associated tag in the app.

  - CASA references the index and source in each of the visualizations using the following tags: certificate_index and certificate_source. If you want to change the field/value pairs for these tags
    + Change the Settings/Manager > Tags, sort by App 'CASA' and edit the certificate_index field-value pair to the new index.
    + Change the deployment-apps index stanza found under $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\casa_deployment_app\casa\inputs.conf.

2. Extract the application to [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps]

**Install to indexers**

**Install to forwarders**

  1) The CASA Splunk Deployment App found at this location [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps\casa\casa_deployment_app\casa] should be moved to the deployment-apps directory on the Deployment Server [$SPLUNK_HOME\etc\deployment-apps] 

  2) The app should then be added, via the GUI, to the desired server class.

### Key concepts for CASA

CASA provides a solution to the current limitations of analyzing Certificate Authorities, using simple visualizations to summarize the trusted CAs found across a network, as well as searching and whitelist/blacklist comparison capabilities.

### Data types

This app provides the index-time and search-time knowledge for the following types of data from X.509 Certificate Authority local Windows machine stores:

**Data type**

- csv, this Sourcetype relates to all of the certificate authority data pulled into the application index. Information relates to X.509 field & value pairs.

These data types support the following Common Information Model data models:

- Certificate, The model was extended to support X.509 V2 and V3.

### Example Use Case ###
Describe a use case in which a hypothetical user installs, configures, then uses the app to achieve a particular goal. Example should be replicable.

1) Monitoring users and administrators whom may have permissions on the enviornment can be tricky. In this use-case we use the blacklist/whitelist 
to identify the workstations that have Certificate Authorities listed on a whitelist. When a user/administrator or even malicious software, installs 
a certificate authority onto a local workstation microsoft CA store as a trusted publisher it could be signed by a trusted but unexpected CA. In particular 
CA's might be created or self signed and appear leggitimate but can be malicious. The best way to detect these types of unauthorized CA's on your network 
is to enter all of the CA's thumbprint(s) into the whitelist csv that are defaults on your network and that have been created by yourself or organization. 
Then once inside of CASA, under the Analytics Dashboard on the "Status of Trusted CAs" panel you can view Gray CAs which are CAs that have not been 
categorized as Black or White listed CAs. By using this method to identify CAs, in this case CASA can effectively help you visualize and monitor active 
CAs on workstations. By default the installation of CASA runs once a week so results may very from day to day.
